When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Pushing your work to a remote location has two main purposes.  First, it allows you to share your work
with others and for the to assist on the work with you.  In additon, remote allows you to work on different computers
Second, by pushing your work to remote, if you were to loose your computer due to a harddrive or operating system
failure, a common occurance with PCs and windows, you would not loose your work.
